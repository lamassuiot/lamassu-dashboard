## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light sky blue (#0f67ff) to evoke trust and security.
- Background color: Off-white (#F0F8FF), a very light tint of the primary blue.
- Accent color: Periwinkle (#a2ecc8) for subtle visual cues and highlights, without overpowering the design.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a clean and modern look, suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use simple line icons for actions and status indicators. Keep the icons consistent in style and size.
- Employ a clean and well-organized layout, focusing on a dashboard-style approach, grouping certificates by type.
- Incorporate subtle transitions for actions and loading states. Keep the animations short and unintrusive.
